ACTC 1.1 - Brad's Triangle Consolidator

ACTC converts independent triangles into triangle strips or fans.  You
can approach a three times geometry speedup on OpenGL and Direct3D
using triangle strips and fans.  If the speed of your application is
limited by how fast your graphics card can paint pixels (and not
transform vertices) then this speedup won't help your frame rate, but
it may free up CPU cycles for more work in your program, which can in
turn do a better job of telling the card what to draw.  You'll find
a more detailed introduction to using ACTC in "manual.html".

ACTC does *not* turn unindexed triangle data into indexed triangle data.
In other words, it will not turn find duplicate vertices in raw 3D vertex
data. (I'm hoping to write a layer on ACTC for that.)

I am not aware of any bugs but I haven't tested the module very
thoroughly against real-life data.  If you find bugs, please visit the
ACTC page on SourceForge at ... and submit a descriptive bug report
including the offending data file, and ACTC's version number.

You can find the most recent release of ACTC by navigating my home page
at http://www.plunk.org/~grantham/.

A quick note about clause #5 in the COPYRIGHT.  All I really want is
to feel some amount of satisfaction that you're using something on
which I worked hard.  An email saying something like "Hey, I'm Joe
Shmoe, and I'm using your code in my widget counter for Orchard Supply
Hardware" is sufficient.
